There is no need to worry though because these are not just for the elitists. Have no fear as everyone is beatable and that is the great thing about curling. There are many different types of competitions where you can enter as a team or enter individually. Some have stipulations, for example two men and two women, and others are just open to anyone. Our competitions are kindly sponsored by many kind individuals and companies around the area and to find a list of these head to our Sponsors page or click here. Competitions are strongly supported by our members not just by taking part but by coming to watch the games and congratulate some great curling.
